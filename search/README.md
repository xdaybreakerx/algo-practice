# Linear Search
- Time complexity: O(n) (where n is the length of the input array)
- Space complexity: O(1) (constant space usage)

# Binary Search
- Time complexity: O(log N)
- Space complexity: O(1) (iterative), O(log N) (recursive)

# Two Crystal Balls
- Time complexity: O(sqrt(N))
- Space complexity: O(1)
